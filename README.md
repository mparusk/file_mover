# The file mover

## What is it?
I had multiple zip files on my computer the contents of which I wanted to 
end up in the same folder. Created a small bash script to do so, and while 
I was at it, I also played around with it for a bit to revise it. 

## Further development ideas
I feel that this code could be structured better and compressed a lot. Admittedly,
it also only covered the basics of bash and I would be very interested in finding
something where I could also practice grep, sed, awk, and something a bit more challenging.
